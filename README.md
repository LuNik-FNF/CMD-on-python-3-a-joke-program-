# Console on the Python 3 (a joke program)
This is not a virus, but just a comic analogue of CMD in Python with MORE stripped-down functionality :)

DISCLAIMER: The author of this program does not bear any responsibility for your PC, because the program in the repository is a joke and does not have any viruses.


# Is this program definitely not a virus?
Of course, it's not a virus. The only thing in the program that might scare you is the GDI effects, which do not affect your PC in any way. This is NOT malware, it's just a joke program that has a more stripped-down Windows Command Line functionality.
